It was designed by Peter C. Moore. The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan I, was later outlawed by then-NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them (this rule, known as the '51 percent' rule, was repealed in the late 2000s).")

        singleShoeObjects = Shoes(shoeName: "Air Jordan II", shoeYear: "Year: 1986", shoeImageName: "aj2", shoeDescription: "The success of the Air Jordan I encouraged Nike to release a new Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was made in Italy. The Air Jordan II introduced better cushioning with a polyurethane midsole and a full length encapsulated Nike air bubble for maximum comfort. The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper.")

In 2012 a Cavalier colorway dubbed the \"Cavs\" was released to honor \"The Shot.\"")

The Air Jordan V was reintroduced in 2000, including a new colorway featuring Michael Jordan's high school (Laney High) colors.")
